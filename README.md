# Machine-Learning
These are my Machine Learning assignments. I built the following models from scratch:
1. Convolutional Neural Network -- CNN.pdf, finetune.py
2. Naive Bayes -- Naive Bayes.pdf, nb.py, nbStopWords.py, smoothing.py, topwords.py, topwordsLogOdds.py
  •  Implemented the Naïve Bayes algorithm from scratch, using smoothing; achieved an accuracy of 86.11%.
  •  Preprocessed datasets and removed stop words, printed out top words to study each class.
3. Concept Learning -- concept learning.pdf, concept learning A.py, concept learning B.py
4. Neural Network -- neural network.pdf, NN_education.py, NN_music.py
  •  Developed one hidden layer feed forward neural network from scratch using NumPy.
  •  Implemented backpropagation to find gradients; used Gradient Descent and Stochastic Gradient Descent to optimize parameters.
  •  Trained the neural network to predict final student total scores and achieve 88% accuracy on test dataset.
