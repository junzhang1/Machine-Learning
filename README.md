# Machine-Learning
These are my Machine Learning assignments. I built the following models from scratch:
1. Convolutional Neural Network -- CNN.pdf, finetune.py
2. Naive Bayes -- Naive Bayes.pdf, nb.py, nbStopWords.py, smoothing.py, topwords.py, topwordsLogOdds.py
3. Concept Learning -- concept learning.pdf, concept learning A.py, concept learning B.py
4. Neural Network -- neural network.pdf, NN_education.py, NN_music.py
